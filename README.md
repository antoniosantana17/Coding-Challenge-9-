# Coding-Challenge-9-

This project is a simple web page that creates interactive div components, each representing a data point, using D3.js. Hovering over the div components demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM for interactive purposes by changing their background color. It shows how to use D3.js in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce dynamic and eye-catching online content. This project serves as a great introduction to using D3.js to provide web components interaction.
